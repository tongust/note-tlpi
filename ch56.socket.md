#scoket 

Two types of scoket:
- SOCKET_STREAM
connection-oriented.
Socket I/O can be blocked if the I/O operations cannot be completed immediately. Nonblocking I/O is also possible, by using the *fcntl()* F_SETFL operation to enable the O_NONBLOCK open file status flag.

TCP socket
- SOCKET_DGRAM
UDP socket

> Socket in client:
    socket
    connection
    rio_writen
    rio_readlineb

> Socket in Server:
    socket
    bind
    listen
    accept
    rio_readlineb
    rio_writen

A typical server application creates one listening socket, binds it to a well-known address, and then handles all client requests by accepting con- nections via that socket.


##Unix domain
int scoket(int domain, int type, int protocal)
- domain: AF_UNIX(unix domain), AF_INET(internet domain)
- type: SOCKET_STREAM (tcp), SOCKET_DGRAM (udp)
- protocal: always is zero.
##Internet domain

#Summary
Sockets allow communication between applications on the same host or on different hosts connected via a network.  socket exists within a communication domain, which determines the range of communication and the address format used to identify the socket. SUSv3 specifies the UNIX ( AF_UNIX ), IPv4 ( AF_INET ), and IPv6 ( AF_INET6 ) communication domains.  Most applications use one of two socket types: stream or datagram. Stream sockets ( SOCK_STREAM ) provide a reliable, bidirectional, byte-stream communication channel between two endpoints. Datagram sockets ( SOCK_DGRAM ) provide unreliable, connectionless, message-oriented communication.
