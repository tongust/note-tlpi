# Advanced signal
## The difference between signal and sigaction 

- sigaction is *more portable* than signal
- W.R.T the signal which is unreliable:
	- On entry to a signal handler, the disposition function of the signal was reset to its default. (corresponds to SA_RESTHAND of sigaction)
	- Delivery of further signals was not blocked during execution of that signal handler. (Corresponds to SANODEFER flag of sigaction.sa_flags)
- Lack automatic restarting of system calls.
